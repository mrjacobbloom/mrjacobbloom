## About me
I'm a fun, energetic, resourceful programmer with a passion for JavaScript, and particularly metaprogramming and esoteric TypeScript. I've spent the last 5 years working with TypeScript/React and the MERN stack at [Anark](https://anark.com), though programming has been a passion of mine since childhood.
